# Background

Therapies for refractory cytomegalovirus infections (with or without resistance [R/R]) in transplant recipients are limited by toxicities. Maribavir has multimodal anti-cytomegalovirus activity through the inhibition of UL97 protein kinase.

# Methods

In this phase 3, open-label study, hematopoietic-cell and solid-organ transplant recipients with R/R cytomegalovirus were randomized 2:1 to maribavir 400 mg twice daily or investigator-assigned therapy (IAT; valganciclovir/ganciclovir, foscarnet, or cidofovir) for 8 weeks, with 12 weeks of follow-up. The primary endpoint was confirmed cytomegalovirus clearance at end of week 8. The key secondary endpoint was achievement of cytomegalovirus clearance and symptom control at end of week 8, maintained through week 16.

# Results

352 patients were randomized (235 maribavir; 117 IAT). Significantly more patients in the maribavir versus IAT group achieved the primary endpoint (55.7% vs 23.9%; adjusted difference [95% confidence interval (CI)]: 32.8% [22.80–42.74]; P < .001) and key secondary endpoint (18.7% vs 10.3%; adjusted difference [95% CI]: 9.5% [2.02–16.88]; P = .01). Rates of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were similar between groups (maribavir, 97.4%; IAT, 91.4%). Maribavir was associated with less acute kidney injury versus foscarnet (8.5% vs 21.3%) and neutropenia versus valganciclovir/ganciclovir (9.4% vs 33.9%). Fewer patients discontinued treatment due to TEAEs with maribavir (13.2%) than IAT (31.9%). One patient per group had fatal treatment-related TEAEs.

# Conclusions

Maribavir was superior to IAT for cytomegalovirus viremia clearance and viremia clearance plus symptom control maintained post-therapy in transplant recipients with R/R cytomegalovirus. Maribavir had fewer treatment discontinuations due to TEAEs than IAT.

# INTRODUCTION

This was a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, open-label, maribavir compared with IAT in HCT and SOT recipients with CMV infections refractory to most recent treatment, with or without resistance to ganciclovir/valganciclovir, foscarnet, and/or cidofovir.

# STUDY DESIGN

|Study treatment phase|Follow-up phase|
|---|---|
|Maribavir|for 8 weeks|
|R|400 mg orally twice daily|
|A|Investigator-assigned therapy after treatment for 8 weeks|
|N|(val/ganciclovir, foscarnet, or cidofovir)|

# RESULTS

352 patients were randomized (maribavir, n=235; IAT, n=117)

|Maribavir|n/N|IAT|
|---|---|---|
|40.1%|59.9%| |
|HCT|23.9%|28/117|
|SOT|55.7%|131/235|

Median (range) duration of exposure was 57 (2–64) days with maribavir and 34 (4–64) days with IAT. Fewer patients discontinued maribavir than IAT due to TEAEs (13.2% vs 31.9%). Dysgeusia was the most frequently reported TEAE in the maribavir group (maribavir: 37.2%; IAT: 3.4%). Maribavir was associated with less acute kidney injury versus foscarnet (8.5% vs 21.3%) and neutropenia versus valganciclovir/ganciclovir (9.4% vs 33.9%). One patient per treatment group had fatal treatment-related TEAEs.

# CONCLUSIONS

Maribavir was superior to IAT for cytomegalovirus viremia clearance, and viremia clearance plus symptom control, recipients with refractory cytomegalovirus infections with or without resistance. Maribavir demonstrated an improved safety profile versus valganciclovir/ganciclovir for myelotoxicity and versus foscarnet for nephrotoxicity, with fewer patients discontinuing maribavir than IAT. The availability of an orally bioavailable therapy without the tolerability issues associated with current therapies may confer patient management benefits.

# METHODS

The roles of the independent Data Monitoring Committee and the Endpoint Adjudication Committee (EAC) are described in the Supplementary Methods.

# Trial Design and Patients

In this phase 3, randomized, open-label, multicenter, active-controlled trial, HCT and SOT recipients (aged ≥12 years) were eligible if they had documented CMV infection in plasma (DNAemia, referred to as viremia), with a CMV DNA screening value of 910 IU/mL or greater in 2 consecutive tests separated by 1 or more day determined by local/central specialty laboratory quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The detailed trial design is shown in Figure 1. The patient’s CMV infection must have been refractory to the most recent treatment, defined as failure to achieve a more than 1-log₁₀ decrease in CMV DNA after 14 days or more of anti-CMV treatment. Patients with resistant CMV infection, defined as 1 or more genetic mutation associated with resistance to ganciclovir/valganciclovir, foscarnet, and/or cidofovir, were also included if they met refractory criteria. Key exclusion criteria included resistant or refractory CMV infection.

# Endpoints and Assessments

The primary endpoint was confirmed CMV viremia clearance at the end of week 8 (regardless of premature treatment discontinuation). Confirmed viremia clearance was defined as plasma CMV DNA level below the lower limit of quantification (<137 IU/mL) in 2 consecutive post-baseline samples, separated by 5 or more days, performed at the central laboratory using COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS TaqMan CMV Test (Roche Diagnostics). Patients who received maribavir rescue or alternative anti-CMV treatment before the end of week 8, or who failed to achieve confirmed CMV viremia clearance at week 8 (including missing virologic data), were considered nonresponders.

The choice of specific IAT was at the investigators’ discretion and could include mono- or combination therapy (≤2 drugs) with intravenous (IV) ganciclovir, oral valganciclovir, IV foscarnet, or IV cidofovir (Supplementary Methods). Switching between ganciclovir and valganciclovir was permitted. A maribavir rescue arm was an option for patients originally assigned IAT after 3 or more weeks of treatment upon medical monitor confirmation of meeting 1 of 3 prespecified criteria (Supplementary Methods).

The study was conducted in accordance with International Conference on Harmonisation of Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Institutional review boards/independent ethics committees at each center approved the trial. All patients/legal guardians provided written informed consent.

Safety endpoints included treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and serious TEAEs (TESAEs).

# Statistical Analysis

of week 8 in the maribavir versus IAT group (62.8% vs 20.3%; adjusted difference: 44.1%; 95% CI: 31.33–56.94%). A numeric treatment difference between maribavir and IAT was also observed among patients with refractory (nonresistant) CMV infection (43.8% vs 32.4%; adjusted difference: 12.6%; 95% CI: −6.24 to 31.43%). Reasons for primary endpoint nonresponders are provided in the Supplementary Methods. Multiple sensitivity analyses were conducted, and the results were consistent with the primary analysis results (Supplementary Table 3).

# Secondary Endpoints

A higher proportion of patients randomized to maribavir versus IAT demonstrated CMV viremia clearance and symptom control at the end of week 8, maintained through week 16 (key secondary endpoint; 18.7% vs 10.3%; adjusted difference: 9.5%; 95% CI: 2.02–16.88%; P = .01) (Figure 4). This effect was consistent at weeks 12 (22.6% vs 10.3%; P < .001) and 20 (18.3% vs 9.4%; P = .008). Viremia clearance after 8 weeks of study-assigned treatment and recurrence during the first 8 weeks of the study are described in the Supplementary Results. Overall, 40 deaths were reported (Supplementary Table 4); 8 deaths were due to CMV disease (maribavir: 4 [1.7%]; IAT: 4 [3.4%]). All-cause mortality was 11.5% with maribavir and 11.1% with IAT.

# Exploratory Evaluations

Kaplan–Meier median (95% CI) time to first confirmed CMV viremia clearance (within study week 8) occurred earlier in the maribavir versus IAT groups (22.0 [21.0–23.0] vs 27.0 [22.0–30.0] days; P = .04, log-rank test) (Supplementary Figure 1).

Clinically relevant recurrence (ie, recurrence among responders, after week 8, who received alternative anti-CMV treatment) occurred less frequently in patients randomized to maribavir (26.0%) than IAT (35.7%). Among the 22 patients who initially received IAT and subsequently received maribavir rescue treatment due to lack of response, 11 (50.0%) achieved confirmed CMV viremia clearance at week 8 of the maribavir rescue treatment phase.

# Safety

Median (range) duration of exposure was 57 (2–64) days with maribavir and 34 (4–64) days with IAT. At least 1 TEAE was reported in 97.4% and 91.4% of patients in the maribavir and IAT groups, respectively (Table 2). Fewer patients discontinued maribavir than IAT due to TEAEs (13.2% and 31.9%) (Supplementary Table 5).

Dysgeusia was the most frequently reported TEAE in the maribavir group (maribavir: 37.2%; IAT: 3.4%) (Table 2); this was reported as mostly mild, and usually resolved either on treatment or shortly after the last dose of maribavir (Kaplan–Meier median time to resolution off treatment: 7 days).

Figure 2. Patient disposition at enrollment, randomization, and follow-up. Percentages were calculated based on the number of patients randomized to each treatment group. Percentages may not total to 100% due to rounding. Serious AEs were recorded until the end of trial participation or resolution (whichever was later); median on-study duration was 141.0 days in each group.

aPatients could have multiple reasons for not being randomized. Other reasons were: patient did not receive an HCT or SOT (n = 1); CMV infection not confirmed refractory to most recent treatment (n = 2); investigator not willing to treat the patient with ganciclovir, valganciclovir, foscarnet, or cidofovir (n = 2); platelet count <25 000/mm³ (n = 5); hemoglobin <8 g/dL (n = 1); eGFR ≤30 mL/min/1.73 m² (n = 1); pregnancy (n = 1); patient was not willing/not able to comply fully with study procedures/restrictions (n = 3); current refractory or resistant CMV infection due to inadequate adherence to prior treatment (n = 2); serum aspartate aminotransferase >5 × ULN at screening, or serum alanine aminotransferase >5 × ULN at screening, or total bilirubin ≥3.0 × ULN at screening (n = 1); received any investigational agent with known anti-CMV activity within 30 days before initiation of study treatment or investigational CMV vaccine at any time (n = 1); and active malignancy (n = 1).

bOne patient per group was randomized but did not receive trial medication. Percentage for each IAT type was calculated based on n = 116. Other reasons for treatment discontinuation in the maribavir group included investigator decision to switch to letermovir, CMV detected in patient’s cerebrospinal fluid, nothing-by-mouth status with mental status change with risk for aspiration, and disease progression (in 1 patient each).

dOther reasons for treatment discontinuation in the IAT group were: low viral load/CMV clearance (with concern of toxicity with continued administration of IAT (n = 9), patient safety (n = 3), patient/investigator request (n = 2), no efficacy and patient ineligible for rescue therapy (n = 1), and peripherally inserted central catheter issues (n = 1).

ᵉThese results are based on investigator determination for the primary reason for study discontinuation. ᶠOther reasons for study discontinuation in maribavir or IAT group included investigator discretion to discontinue 1 patient before dosing with maribavir, and no efficacy with IAT for a patient who was not eligible for rescue therapy. Per protocol, maribavir rescue arm treatment was discontinued in 1 patient due to CMV encephalitis.

hOne patient was unable to complete follow-up visits in the study due to hospitalization in a different city and therefore did not complete the maribavir rescue study period.

# DISCUSSION

This phase 3 trial in transplant recipients with R/R CMV infection demonstrated that maribavir was superior to IAT (ganciclovir, valganciclovir, foscarnet, or cidofovir) for CMV viremia clearance at week 8. Patients in the maribavir group had a lower treatment discontinuation rate than those with IAT and also had reduced frequency of neutropenia versus valganciclovir/ganciclovir and AKI versus foscarnet (treatment-limiting toxicities frequently associated with available therapies). The inclusion of a rescue arm within the study design addressed the antecedent possibility of poor outcomes with IAT.

The benefit with respect to viremia clearance at week 8 of maribavir over IAT was consistent across key subpopulations including HCT and SOT recipients, and patients with resistant CMV infection. This benefit was also maintained in analyses limited to patients completing 8 weeks of study-assigned treatment, included patients in the IAT group who switched to alternative (nonstudy) anti-CMV treatment before week 8 as responders (if meeting criteria of viremia clearance at week 8) or controlled for early treatment discontinuations in the IAT group. Cytomegalovirus viremia clearance appeared earlier with maribavir versus IAT. Notably, CMV viremia persistence in patients with refractory or resistant CMV may be the harbinger of clinical deterioration. The CMV Consensus Forum recently concluded that treatment of viremia prevented disease, viral load kinetics predicted progression to disease, and viral load is an appropriate surrogate endpoint in CMV clinical trials. Thus, the results reported here show that maribavir enables CMV viremia clearance (including drug-resistant strains) with an improved safety profile, illustrating the potential of maribavir to change CMV infection management.

Significantly more patients in the maribavir versus IAT group achieved viremia clearance and symptom control at week 8.

Data are presented as n (%). The cidofovir group was not considered in the application of the 10% cutoff due to low patient numbers (n = 6). The on-treatment observation period started at the time of study-assigned treatment initiation through 7 days after the last dose of study-assigned treatment or through 21 days if cidofovir was used, or until the maribavir rescue treatment initiation or until the nonstudy CMV treatment initiation, whichever was earlier. Adverse events were coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, version 23.0. Abbreviations: CMV, cytomegalovirus; IAT, investigator-assigned therapy; TEAE, treatment-emergent adverse event.

Overall, 7 patients received a combination of valganciclovir/ganciclovir and foscarnet (not included in the table). Events such as worsening of CMV viremia were coded to the preferred term of CMV viremia.

with maintenance to week 16, although the percentage of patients achieving this endpoint was low in both groups. As CMV is a latent virus, in the setting of continued immunosuppression and simultaneous cessation of effective antiviral therapy CMV viremia recurrence off treatment was expected. Among patients meeting the primary endpoint, CMV recurrence necessitating additional anti-CMV treatment in the follow-up period occurred less frequently with maribavir than IAT. The results raise important questions about the current treatment paradigm for these patients, as available agents have limitations for prolonged use. The availability of an orally bioavailable therapy without the tolerability issues associated with current therapies may confer patient management benefits.

Despite shorter drug exposure with IAT than maribavir in this study, as treatment discontinuations were more than 2-fold higher with IAT than maribavir, the incidence of TESAEs was similar between groups and treatment-related TESAEs occurred less frequently with maribavir than IAT. Dysgeusia, while common with maribavir, only led to discontinuation in 0.9% of patients in the maribavir group. Importantly, consistent with previous studies, maribavir-treated patients had substantially lower rates of neutropenia and renal impairment compared with valganciclovir/ganciclovir and foscarnet, respectively. Safety data from this phase 3 study were consistent with those from a phase 2 study of maribavir in R/R CMV infections in HCT/SOT recipients, wherein 400–1200-mg BID doses of maribavir were administered for up to 24 weeks. In the current study, the TEAE of immunosuppressant drug concentration level increase was more common in patients receiving maribavir than IAT. Increased immunosuppressant levels have been previously observed in patients treated with maribavir (particularly at the highest [1200 mg BID] dose), and maribavir is known to inhibit P-gp, a transporter involved in distribution and disposition of standard immunosuppression medications.

The current study has limitations, including an open-label design, which may have introduced bias. Blinding was not feasible due to the need for individualized IAT drug selection/dosing adjustments and the different routes of treatment administration for IAT compared with maribavir. While this study was designed to include pediatric patients aged 12 years and older, no pediatric patients were enrolled. The benefit of maribavir over IAT was consistent across key subpopulations, including a numerically greater response in patients with refractory CMV without genotyped resistance. However, this study was not powered to detect differences between treatments in this patient subgroup. Further, as patients were not stratified by refractory or resistant CMV at randomization, more patients with refractory-only CMV were included in the maribavir group. Nevertheless, a numerical trend for maribavir versus IAT was observed for this patient subgroup, in alignment with overall study results.

With regard to the patients who died due to CMV encephalitis, it is important to note that limited preclinical data suggest that maribavir does not cross the blood–brain barrier. Patients with CMV encephalitis were excluded from the study, and patients who developed new-onset encephalitis while receiving treatment were also excluded. A higher study discontinuation rate before week 8 in the IAT group was also observed in the study. These discontinuations were primarily due to adverse events and toxicities known to be associated with available anti-CMV agents.

were performed to address this potential bias. Finally, the study-specified treatment duration may have necessitated patients with residual CMV at the end of the 8-week treatment phase to receive an alternative treatment during the follow-up phase and who were therefore considered nonresponders to the key secondary endpoint.

In conclusion, maribavir was superior to IAT with respect to CMV clearance in transplant recipients with R/R CMV infection, and sensitivity analyses demonstrated that a benefit of maribavir over IAT with respect to CMV clearance at week 8 was observed regardless of early discontinuations or the need for alternative treatment. Maribavir demonstrated an improved safety profile versus valganciclovir/ganciclovir with respect to neutropenia and versus foscarnet with respect to AKI, which are treatment-limiting toxicities frequently associated with these conventional therapies. Maribavir represents a promising treatment for R/R CMV infections.
